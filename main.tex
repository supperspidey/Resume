\section{Experience}
\cventry{July 2015--Present}{iOS Software Engineer}{MuseAmi, Inc.}{Princeton, NJ}{}{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Involve in development of \href{https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/musicpal-snap-hear-play-learn/id976261614?mt=8}{\textbf{MusicPal}}, iOS app that converts camera captures of physical sheet music into interactive scores, including:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Implement adaptive user interface (UI), resulting in scalable and glitch-free layouts across all devices supported by iOS 8 and iOS 9
				\item Optimize various features using multi-threading, leading to more responsive user experience
				\item Build and maintain matching game whose outcomes are used to improve underlying optical music recognition engine, with all supported devices running at 60 frames per second
				\item Diagnose C++ layers used to draw music scores from machine learning's output and render audio
			\end{enumerate}
		\item Convert all files written in Swift 1.0 to Swift 2.0 language and reinforce rules for defensive programming, leading to safer and better code
		\item Collaborate with other product engineering team members in planning, executing, and reviewing all agile development cycles of MusicPal, with new feature deployed every two weeks
