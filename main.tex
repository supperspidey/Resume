\section{Experience}
\cventry{January 2017--Present}{iOS Software Engineer}{Vimeo, LLC}{New York, NY}{}{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Fully participate in planning and building subscription video-on-demand feature of Vimeo iOS app
	\end{itemize}
}
\vspace{5 pt}
\cventry{April 2016--November 2016}{Software Engineer}{Tonic Design Co.}{Philadelphia, PA}{}{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Collaborated with both in-house and client engineering teams on several iOS projects, most notably:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Janssen's INVOKANA Check Your Numbers} --- increased test coverage on adherence model from
				50\% to 100\%, resulting in more correct and consistent data visualization across application
				\item \textbf{Checkpoint Systems' Cycle Count SDK} --- developed high-performant
				radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag reading algorithm, established reliable
				connection between iOS devices and supported RFID readers, and ensured 100\% test
				coverage on entire library
			\end{itemize}
		\item Researched extensively on Artificial Neural Networks and related algorithms such as
		k-Nearest Neighbors, k-Means, and Radial Basis Functions
		\item Using Microsoft's Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS) and Phillyfunguide's REST API,
		prototyped intelligent system that could converse naturally and recommend cultural events in Philadelphia

			\begin{itemize}
				\item Implemented adaptive user interface, resulting in scalable
				layouts across all devices supported by iOS 8 and iOS 9
				\item Optimized saving and loading data using multi-threading,
				increasing responsiveness on least powerful device by 10 times
				\item Built and maintained mini game whose outcomes were used to
				improve underlying optical music recognition engine, with all
				supported devices running at 60 frames per second
				\item Diagnosed C++ layers used to render audio and draw music
				notations from machine learning's output
				\item Collaborated with other product engineering team members
				in planning, executing, and reviewing all agile development
				cycles of MusicPal, with new feature deployed every two weeks
